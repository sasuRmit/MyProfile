<h1>Personal Information</h1>



<p>Sasu Kankaanpaa</p>
<p>s3615282@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>Student Number S3615282</p>
<p>I was born in Turku, Finland but moved to England at a very young age. I also lived in Spain and China before coming to Australia. I can speak a small amount of Finnish but don't have the opportunity to use it as much as I used to. </p>
<p>Having spent many years in England I grew a love for soccer and am often up very late into the night or early morning to watch the games in England and Europe. </p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>Without really knowing it I have been interested in IT since I can remember. I am interested in most aspects of IT from hardware to application code. Seeing the changes in hardware over the years has always been specifically interesting to me. I have experience in IT from working as a database administrator for Microsoft SQL Server.</p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT because RMIT appeared to be the best and most convenient option to study online. Once I compared the other universities I chose to come to RMIT because of the good thing I had heard about the online courses and as I am working full time the ability to do most of the course online in my own time. I had also heard good things about the online courses so made the decision to choose RMIT easy.</p>

<p>I expect to learn more about how IT impacts much of the world, the implications of this and how these IT systems are developed. I also expect to learn more skills for working in groups and collaboration. </p>

<p>The position is for a SQL Server Consultant who would assist clients with a range of SQL server related issues. This position is appealing to me as it provides the opportunity to work on a large range of issues and scenarios and with the latest tools and services available on the market. </p>
<p>This position requires many years of experience as a database administrator and experience with a very wide range of SQL Server features and services, and knowledge of the Azure cloud services. Relevant qualifications and Microsoft certifications of MCSE would be look on preferably but are not required. </p>
<p>I currently have 4 years of experience as a database administrator and do have a Microsoft certification for SQL Server 2016. I have experience with many or the features and services of SQL Server but have limited knowledge of some as I have not had exposure to them yet. </p>
<p>I plan to keep working as a database administrator to gain more experience in more SQL Server features and services. I will also try to obtain some Microsoft certifications in Azure and once I finish this course I will have a good amount of qualifications for the roll. </p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<div>

<h2>Myers-Briggs test</h2>

<p>Result: ISFP, taken on https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality</p>

<p>ISFPs are gentle caretakers who live in the present moment and enjoy their surroundings with cheerful, low-key enthusiasm. They are flexible and spontaneous, and like to go with the flow to enjoy what life has to offer. ISFPs are quiet and unassuming, and may be hard to get to know. However, to those who know them well, the ISFP is warm and friendly, eager to share in life's many experiences.</p>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
<p>I feel this result is reasonably accurate for me and I am happy with the result. In my opinion there are more positives then negatives. </p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
<p>These results will influence me to try and be more open and assertive when working in a team. I do prefer to work individually so I will have to be more willing to seek assistance from a team and provide assistance. </p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
<p>When forming a team, I think I would work best if there is a clear leader of the team that looks at the bigger picture can communicate well with everyone in the team. I would also not do well in a team that has members that do not put in their fair share as I am not likely to confront them. </p>


<h2>Learning Style</h2>

<p>Result: Tactile, http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml</p>

<p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still</p>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
<p>This result backs up what I believed. I have always preferred to attempt things and learn it on the go rather than reading the theory behind it. This can be detrimental sometimes as something can be missed so some trial and error is required which can take more time. </p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
<p>This result will make me ask team members to walk me through or show me how to do something instead of receiving book or article on what need to be done. I would also try to assists my other team members thing that I may not know completely but it gives me hands on experience with it. </p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
<p>This will make me look for team members that are very open to communicate and assist with problems. I will also want team members that are not afraid to ask for help so that the issue can be worked on together. </p>

<h1>My Project</h1>

<p>My project aims to be an interactive and engaging fitness tracking application on IOS devices by including a number of puzzle games and rewarding users for updating a number of daily fitness trackers with rewards for the games.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult things for a new application is to retain active users. By rewarding users for using the fitness and wellbeing trackers users are more likely to be active and continue to use the application. This will also help people improve there quality of life.</p>

<p>The application will have two main functions, tracking user fitness activity and wellbeing, and puzzle games to keep the user in the application. It will track a number of activity stats available from the IOS Health app which includes steps taken, distance travelled and flights of stairs climbed, this data will be available to the user in a number of different reports to give them insights into their activity. The user will also be able to add and track exercise, fluid and food consumption, and weight. The puzzle games will include a number of different puzzles at a varying degree of difficulty so the user can play a relaxing game or really challenge themselves. The games will also have trackers that will allow the user to see if they are able to compete puzzles quicker and in a smaller amount of moves and can compare their scores with other users if desired. </p>

<p>When the user updates their exercise and food trackers they receive small bonuses the assist in certain puzzles. This is to encourage the user to be more active with tracking items. The encouragement will hopefully mean that the user continues to track items they will be able to use the data and reports to see any patterns and make any changes if necessary.</p>

<p>The tools that I would use are Unity 3D to create the application and puzzle games. This will also allow me to access data from a MySQL database that would hold the userâ€™s data and a server for the database and application. For the food calories calculation, I would access the openfoodfacts API or data dump (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) to provide accurate information to the user. </p>


<p>This would require programing, data analysis and marketing skills. These are to developed the application, to provide meaning full insight to the users from their data and to market the application successfully. These skills and software required would be feasible to acquire.</p>

<p>If this project is successful it will assist people to have a long term view of their lifestyles. I would not have a large scale impact but would assist a number of people to improve their quality of life. </p>
